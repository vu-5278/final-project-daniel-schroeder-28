# What is my project?

My project is an android app that allows users to make flashcard sets and then study a set of their choosing.

# How was it designed?

It is written in Java and XML (for UI) and uses gradle to build and run unit tests. The unit tests and automated UI tests are run in github actions upon a push.

# How to build/run

1. Clone repo
2. In Android Studio select File -> Open -> find cloned repo and select OK
3. The project will automatically open and build for the first time
4. To run select Runin the toolbar and then Run 'app'
5. An Emulator may need to be set up, follow prompts by Android Studio to do this ( Most testing done on Pixel 5 API 30 but should work with most devices)
