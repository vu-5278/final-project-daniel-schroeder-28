# Final Project

### Overview of the Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to design and implement a larger (for the scope of the class) software application in Java that demonstrates knowledge of the concepts from class. Some examples of possible projects include: 

  1. An HTTP API deployed to the cloud or runnable as a container
  2. A command-line tool with a high-quality interface
  3. An Android mobile application
  4. A Java lambda service in something like AWS Lambda
  5. Some other thing that has equivalent functionality / complexity

Requirements for all projects:

  1. High-quality written documentation to use, understand, and enhance the project
  2. Good tests
  3. Well thought-out architecture
  

There are no restrictions on what type of application you write. You can also use a language other than Java. However, you must appropriately scope your application to the time available for the assignment and deliver a finished product. Your application must be reasonably _complete_ at the end of the assignment. In addition, your application must have tests to demonstrate that it works. 

### Present Your Project

In one of the last two live sessions you will give a presentation on your project. Ask the instrutor how long your presentation should be. You should explain: 1) what the application is, 2) the overall architecture, and 3) what were the interesting challenges / solutions / tools involved. Your presentation should include a demo of your application. You should include a couple of visuals (e.g., slides), demonstrating the overall architecture and concepts. Please be selective in what code you show so that the audience can follow your presentation -- you don't need to walk through the application line-by-line.

### README File ###

You must replace this README file in your repo with your own (make a copy first!). Your README should describe each of the following: 1) what your application is, 2) how it is designed, and 3) instructions and/or sample data to build / run it. Make sure and explain how the concepts map to the seven weeks that you chose.


***Your tests should run automatically on every commit using GitHub actions.***


### Concluding Remarks

This assignment is intentionally open-ended. It is essential that you take time up-front to think through what you can reasonably design, build, test, and document in the allotted time. You should scale the complexity of what you do to your programming skills. 

### REMINDERS:

* Start early and ask questions.
  
* Build something simple and beautiful: https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/
